# AgroMall-Android-Assessment
### Getting Started 

## Installation
AgroMall requires a minimum API level of 16. Clone the repository. The App makes use of the Google Place and Google Maps API, You will need to get a billed Google Maps API key from your Google Console
[here](https://developers.google.com/places/android-sdk/get-api-key) in order to enable the Google Place Functionality, If you donâ€™t already have an account, you will need to create one in order to get an API Key.
In your project's root directory, create a file `apikey.properties` and include the following lines:

`GOOGLE_MAP_API_KEY = ""`


* [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel) to store and manage UI-related data in a lifecycle conscious way.
* [LiveData](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata) to handle data in a lifecycle-aware fashion.
* [Navigation Component](https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation) to handle all navigations and also passing of data between destinations.
* [Material Design](https://material.io/develop/android/docs/getting-started/)
* [Coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines-overview.html) used to manage the local storage i.e. `writing to and reading from the database`. Coroutines help in managing background threads and reduces the need for callbacks.
* [Data Binding](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/data-binding/) to declaratively bind UI components in layouts to data sources.
* [Room](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/room) persistence library which provides an abstraction layer over SQLite to allow for more robust database access while harnessing the full power of SQLite.
* [Android KTX](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/ktx) which helps to write more concise, idiomatic Kotlin code.

## Architecture
The architecture of this application relies and complies with the following points below:
* A single-activity architecture, using the [Navigation Components](https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation) to manage fragment operations.
* Pattern [Model-View-ViewModel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93viewmodel)(MVVM) which facilitates a separation of development of the graphical user interface.
* [Android architecture components](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/) which help to keep the application robust, testable, and maintainable

#### Modules
The App is very much modularised into different packages to ensure a clean design code all of which performs different roles in the MVVM Structure of the App.
Those packages includes.
* authentication
* local
* dataSource
* UI 
etc
